Hey there. I'm Jason Lo, or as I'm better known as throughout the internet, y2bd. I'm currently a college student in California.

If you came here knowing who I am, you probably either know me as a [Windows Phone app developer](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/store/publishers?publisherId=y2bd), or as one of the directors of the gaming-centric YouTube channel, [Nopefully](http://youtube.com/nopefully).

Here are some ways to contact me:

* [Email me at jason@y2bd.me](mailto:jason@y2bd.me)
* [Tweet @y2bd](https://twitter.com/y2bd)
* [Reddit PM y2bd](http://reddit.com/u/y2bd)
