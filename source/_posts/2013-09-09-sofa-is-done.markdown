It's been almost two months now, but Sofa, my journal application for Windows Phone 8, is finally done!

First of all, the last time I referred to Sofa I called it 'Quill'. That was its work-in-progress name, but I had to change it because I couldn't find a nice quill vector to use as the main logo. No problem, Sofa was actually how I referred to the app within the code anyway, and it's still a nice title. Maybe I'll use Quill for something else...

This is easily the biggest programming project (hell, maybe even general project) that I've worked on, and I've learned a *ton* since I started. I now have a much better grip on Git, and by that I mean I know more than `git commit -am "Did stuff"` and `git push origin master`. I learned more about branching, merging, stashing (ran into a nasty problem with that), and am currently learning about rebasing because I have way too many one-line-changed commits. 

I've also learned a lot more about the tools and libraries I've been using in my small WP dev 'career'. From the Windows Phone Toolkit (which I ended up having to fork to fix a bug), to MVVMLight (minimal code-behind, I promise!), to new tools like SQLite and Microsoft's LiveSDK (for SkyDrive integration, need those bullet-point features).

I *think* I've also learned to finally accept a v1 product--there are tons of features that I want for Sofa, but I needed to realize that if I spend way too much time trying to perfect it, I'll fall into my trap of getting frustrated, getting bored, and then giving up on it altogether (I have enough half-finished VS solutions to show the effects of this).

The last week and a half have been spent with some *awesome* beta testers who have been extremely helpful in finding bugs, little quirks, and feature suggestions. I am definitely having beta periods for all of my serious apps from now on.

Sofa has been in the approval process for the last two days and you wouldn't believe how nervous I am. Every morning I wake up, scramble to my phone, and falter, looking at that mail icon with a number next to it. I've gotten "Certification Failed" for my other apps before (Dammit Pinned, get along with the budget phones!), and I really don't want that to happen now. There's two weeks until I have to move back to Southern California for college, and I have no idea what kind of free time I'll have once that happens.

Wish me luck!
